Talks about Domain-Driven Design

## Eric Evans
- [DDD: putting the model to work](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/model-to-work-evans/)
- [DDD: Strategic Design](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/strategic-design-evans/)
- [What I've learned about DDD since the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE6Hxz4yomA&t=3s) (2012)
  - including discussion of Domain Events as a new Building Block, and Big Ball of Mud within Strategic Design
- [DDD and Microservices: At Last, Some Boundaries!](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ddd-microservices-2016/) (2016)
  - a key point is in the title; while microservices have overhead, they are a way of establishing hard boundaries between new DDD models and monolithic ones. Simple logical boundaries (e.g. within monoliths) have a track record of failing to be robust over time, leading to the Big Ball of Mud
