- [DDD and Microservices: At Last, Some Boundaries!](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/ddd-microservices-2016/) (2016)
  - a key point is in the title; while microservices have overhead, they are a way of establishing hard boundaries between new DDD models and monolithic ones. Simple logical boundaries (e.g. within monoliths) have a track record of failing to be robust over time, leading to the Big Ball of Mud
